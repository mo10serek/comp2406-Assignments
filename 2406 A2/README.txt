can access. UnZip the file you are using. Then you need to go to terminal and type "cd" and then locate the file "2406 A2" in the terminal.
"cd 2406 A2" and then "cd program" and type "node server.js" to run the file. You will see this code,

using. Now you have the program running. You can load a song by typing one of these songs: Brown Eyed Girl,
Never My Love, Peaceful Easy Feeling, and Sister Golden Hair or any in the songs directory.

It will put the title, author and the lyrics in the canvas. you can move the words in the canvas and you

words or cords to different places or to different lines. When you press refresh, it will load the lirics bellow the 
canvas. When you press save as and enter its new title, it will upload the document to the server and save it as a txt file.

Issues:
Sometimes it locate the cursor on another position. To fix its position, move the word on the top left word.
The canvas is small because it helps to reads the cursor's position.
Don't put a note after a letter and before a space. It will not compile. 
Put the note above the space to put it bettween two words.
