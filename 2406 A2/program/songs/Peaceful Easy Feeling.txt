Peaceful Easy Feeling

I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want [C#min] to [C#min] sleep with you in the desert night
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground
