sparkling earrings

I like the way your Peaceful Easy Feeling lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want [C#min]to slee[C#min]p with you in the desert night
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground
