Install: 
The only thing I install is socket.io
npm install socket.io

Launch: 
To launch the program, you need to download the file to a documentary that the terminal or command prompt
can access. UnZip the file you are using. Then you need to go to terminal and type "cd" and then locate 
the file "2406 A3" in the terminal. "cd 2406 A3" and then "cd program" and type "node server.js" to run 
the file. You will see this code,

Server Running at PORT 3000  CNTL-C to quit
To Test: open several browsers at:
http://localhost:3000/assignment3.html

Testing:
copy "http://localhost:3000/assignment3.html" from the terminal and paste it in the browser you most likely you are
using. also paste it the link to another browser and make the computer that you can see the program in two windows
Now you have the program running, press the HOME button in the first browser and press the VISITOR button in the 
other window. In the first window click anywhere in the shadded area and aim to the curling circle. You will see
that in the other window is doing the same thing as in the first window. When it is the visitor turn, click anywhere 
in the shadded area on the other window and aim to the curling circle. Also you will see in the first window is doing 
the same thing as in the first window. Keep doing it until there is no curling stones and when a player click the saded
area. It will restart all the scores and the positions of the rocks.
