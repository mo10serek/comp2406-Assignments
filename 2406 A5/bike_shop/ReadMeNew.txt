Launch:
To launch the program, you need to download the file to a documentary that the terminal or command prompt
can access. UnZip the file you are using. Then you need to go to terminal and type "cd" and then locate 
the file "2406 A5" in the terminal. "cd demo_code2019" and then "cd bike_shop" and type npn install to install 
the express.js file and other files in dependencies in package.json file.
Then type "cd seed". Then type "node populate-for-star-tup.js". It will load the categories and the products 
and two accounts that are both admin. then type npm start to run the program and type 
http://localhost:3000 to the browser or if you are hosting on a remote server like openstack it might be:

http://134.117.216.34:3000
